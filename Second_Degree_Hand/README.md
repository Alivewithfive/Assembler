Second Degree Hand by David
===========================

This is a mechanical hand made for users with a functional thumb. It includes an opening that allows the user to utilize their thumb along with mechanical fingers.

This hand includes a couple of unusual features:

First, this hand allows for two degrees of freedom in the motion. Most similar hands only allow the user to raise or lower the fingers. This one also allows the user to move the fingers side-to-side. A demonstration of the two degrees of freedom can be seen at:

Second, this hand includes springs on the tuners. This resolves some issues so that the hand has dramatically improved grip. A demonstration of this feature can be seen at:

This design is also fully parametric OpenSCAD files. Although there are STL files attached, they are just for example purposes. The intention is that each individual will create their own unique STLs from the SCAD files.

There is currently no option for a mechanical thumb in this design. There are a couple of other hand designs that include a mechanical thumb. If someone really wants a thumb added to this design (maybe because of the two degrees of freedom) I can maybe add it.

I am not marking this one a work in progress. The one I was making for my sister is pretty much complete and working well. I am working on an updated version, but that will likely be a new version 3.

As always... This is provided in the hope that it will be beneficial. It is provided, however, without any warranty of any sort. Use at your own risk, and seek appropriate medical attention. If you do use it, and you experience any problems, immediately discontinue use.
