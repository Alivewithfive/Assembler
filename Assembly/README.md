e-NABLE : Assembly
==================

Command line tool that assembles parts from individual designs.

For parametric designs, it loads them directly.

For STL files, it loads a component wrapper that loads the STL, and (in the future) performs required scaling,
translation, etc., to fit the component into the assembly.
